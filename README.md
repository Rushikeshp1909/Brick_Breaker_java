In this Task i have developed a Brick Breaker game which is a classic game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball, breaking bricks arranged at the top of the screen. The objective is to clear all the bricks while keeping the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. 

Key Components :
1. Paddle : The paddle is controlled by the player to bounce the ball back towards the bricks. It moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.
2. Ball : The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off the walls, paddle, and bricks. Its trajectory changes upon collision with different objects.
3. Bricks : The wall of bricks at the top of the screen is the primary target. Each brick has a certain durability, and it disappears when hit by the ball. The player earns 5 points for each brick destroyed.
4. Score : Losing a ball without catching it with the paddle results in losing a life and can restart a game with clicking on Enter key. The player's score increases with each brick destroyed and displayed on screen.
5. Game Over : The game ends when either all the bricks are destroyed, or if ball goes down without hit on paddle. and a game-over screen is displayed, showing the final score and options to restart the game.

As a developing a Brick Breaker game helped me solidify my understanding of OOPs concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Each game element such as paddle, ball, and bricks. And Implementing collision detection for the ball bouncing off the paddle. 
And with Managing user input for controlling the paddle's movement sharpened my skills in event-driven programming.
